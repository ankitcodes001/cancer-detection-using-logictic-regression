# BREAST CANCER PREDICTION Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set
Breast cancer is one of main cause of death cancer.Breast cancer is the most common cancer in American women, except for skin cancers. Currently, the average risk of a woman in the United States developing breast cancer sometime in her life is about 13%. This means there is a 1 in 8 chance she will develop breast cancer. This also means there is a 7 in 8 chance she will never have the disease.


In recent years, incidence rates have increased slightly (by 0.3% per year).To overcome the many difficulties of the feature-based approaches, machine  learning methods are becoming important alternatives. A method for the classification of hematoxylin and eosin stained breast biopsy classification model  is proposed. The main role of these various classifiers are to to process the data and simply classify it .There are various methods like logistics regression,desiciontree classifier and random forest etc by which we are so easily predict the required outputs .


In this given data set we have a set of patients with thier id number and we have to predict that how many patients are having malignant and how many are having benign .
So for the prediction i have used three classification models and compare their accuraries of prediction.


       To do this project :
       
       
       
       you will need jupyter notebook or you can also use pycharm as ide for running the program.
